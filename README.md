7 《too late》

原文
The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious stones were just ordinary stones. Someone had already stolen the real diamonds and replaced them with worthless stones.

飞机误点了，侦探们在机场等了整整一上午。他们正期待着从南非来的一包贵重的钻石。几小时以前，有人向警方报告，说有盗贼企图偷走这些钻石。当飞机到达时，一些侦探等在主楼内，另一些侦探等在停机坪上。有两个人把包裹拿下飞机，进了海关。这时两个侦探把住门口，另外两个侦探打开了包裹。令他们吃惊的是，那些宝石竟是一些普通的石头。有人已经偷走了真正的钻石，用一些毫无价值的石头来代替。

* 注意: while从句中常用进行时态
4. 宾语从句
* 例句: Someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds.
* 结构: 主句 + that + 从句
* 注意: that在口语中可以省略


过去将来时

从句：would try（过去将来时）

He said he would come tomorrow. 他说他明天会来。

She told me she would finish the work by Friday. 她告诉我她会在周五前完成工作。

课后自我练习

原句：A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. 
过去完成时：描述在过去某个特定时间点或另一个过去动作发生之前，已经完成的动作。它强调的是“过去的过去”。
before, after, by the time, when (当表示“在那之前”时), already, just, never

我的造句：
- [ ] one hour ago, I had ordered breakfast takeout, the deliveryman took it on my home door, but he didn’t give me a phone call. So I had waited and waited.In the end, I almost lated for work. So  I decided to work . When I opened my door, I found that my breakfast was laying in the floor.
为什么不适合用过去完成时？
* One hour ago, I had ordered breakfast takeout...：One hour ago 是一个明确的过去时间点。你“点餐”这个动作就发生在一个小时前，并没有另一个“过去”的动作来作为参照，表明“点餐”发生在这个参照点之前。
- [ ] One hour ago, I ordered breakfast takeout. 
一般过去时： 描述在过去某个明确的时间点发生并结束的动作或状态。
时间标志：yesterday, last night, two years ago, in 2005, when I was a child
The deliveryman delivered it to my door, but he didn't give me a phone call. So I waited and waited. In the end, I was almost late for work. When I opened my door, I found that my breakfast was lying on the floor.

- [ ] A week earlier, I was invited to live in my friend’s house. This Monday morning, I went to the office from my house. When I got off work at noon, I   took my luggage to her house. But I had found her didn’t  have body wash. unfortunately, I have not bring body wash. So I have bought it on line. It would deliver in the second day.
为什么不适合用过去完成时？
* But I had found her didn’t have body wash.：你“发现”这个动作发生在“你带行李到她家”之后。这里的“发现”和“她没有沐浴露”是同时存在的，或者说“发现”这个动作发生在特定的过去时间点（你到她家后）。这里没有“发现”这个动作比另一个过去的动作更早发生的意思。
* Unfortunately, I have not bring body wash.：这里你想要表达的是“之前没带”。
    * 如果你是强调在“发现她没有沐浴露”那个过去的时刻，你此前没有带，那么使用过去完成时 I hadn't brought any myself 是非常恰当的，因为它强调了“没带”这个动作发生在“发现”这个过去的动作之前。
    * 如果你只是陈述一个过去的事实，用 I didn't bring any 也可以。
正确用法：
* But I found she didn't have any body wash. (发现是在过去发生的)
* Unfortunately, I hadn't brought any myself. (没带是发生在我发现她没有沐浴露之前)


- [ ] A week earlier, I was invited to stay at my friend's house. This Monday morning, I went to the office from my own house. When I got off work at noon, I brought my luggage to her house. But I found she didn't have any body wash. Unfortunately, I hadn't brought any myself. So I bought some online, and it was delivered the next day.

一般过去时 (Simple Past)
定义： 描述在过去某个明确的时间点发生并结束的动作或状态。
特点：
* 动作发生在过去，与现在无关。
* 通常与明确的过去时间状语连用，如：yesterday, last night, two years ago, in 2005, when I was a child 等。
* 强调动作发生的时间或顺序。
例句：
1. I watched a movie yesterday. (昨天看电影，动作在昨天结束)
2. She went to Paris last summer. (去年夏天去了巴黎，动作在去年夏天结束)
3. When I was a child, I loved chocolate. (童年时期喜欢巧克力，状态在过去)

* 表示先后顺序：过去完成时的动作发生在另一个过去动作之前。
* 常与 before, after, by the time, when (当表示“在那之前”时), already, just, never 等词连用。
结构： had + 动词的过去分词 (V3)
例句：
1. When I arrived at the station, the train **had already left**.
    * 分析：I arrived (我到达车站) 是过去发生的一个动作。the train had already left (火车已经开走了) 发生在我到达车站这个动作之前。所以，火车开走是“过去的过去”。
2. She had finished her homework before she watched TV.
    * 分析：finished her homework (做完作业) 发生在 watched TV (看电视) 这个动作之后。
3. By the time we got to the cinema, the film **had started**.

**16 《A polite request》**

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it.

You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket.

However, this does not always happen.

Traffic police are sometimes very polite.

During a holiday in Sweden,  I found this note on my car: “Sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a No Parking area.”

You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.

If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!


句子
1. 条件句
* If + 现在时, will + 动词原形
    * If I park here, will I get a ticket?
* If + 过去时, would + 动词原形（虚拟条件句）
    * "If I were you, I wouldn't park here."
    * "What would you do if you were in my position?"
2. 情态动词的礼貌用法
* "Could you please move your car?"
* "Would you mind not parking here?"
* "I wonder if you could help me."

in this way	以这种方式	In this way, we can solve it.
ask for	请求，要求	He asked for help.

obey 遵守

练习题

2️⃣ 我能请你帮个忙吗？我想知道这里是否可以停车。
Could I ask you for help? I want to know whether there could park or not.
Could you do me a favor? I wonder if I can park here.

whether从句中缺少主语，park是不及物动词，不能用there作主语
3️⃣ 交通警察告诉司机不要在这个区域停车。
The traffic policeman told the driver that don’t park the car not to park in this area.
tell someone to do/not to do
间接引语中，祈使句要转换为不定式结构
4️⃣ 如果我是你，我就会注意那些交通标志。
If I were you, I would notice  that pay attention to those traffic signs.
notice → pay attention to（更地道）
signs是复数，应该用those
5️⃣ 他用这种方式提醒人们遵守交通规则。
✅ He reminded people to obey traffic rules in this way.
6️⃣ 你介意把车移开吗？这里是禁止停车区域。
Would  you mind move moving the car away? Here is a no-parking area.

7️⃣ 如果你不遵守这些规则，你一定会收到罚单。

非虚拟条件句(真实客观存在的情况非想象)：if + 现在时, will + 动词原形
8️⃣ 我想知道您是否愿意帮助我解决这个问题。
I wonder if you would be so kind as to （could） help me to solve this problem.
could 也正确，但 Would you be so kind as to... = 非常礼貌的请求
help sb do something
9️⃣ 警察说如果我再次违反交通规则，就会被罚款。
The traffic policeman said that if I obeyed broke the traffic rules again, I would receive a ticket be fined.
fine adj.令人满意的，可以接受的；值得崇敬的；健康的，出色的，美好的

n 罚金，罚款；微小颗粒
🔟 他没有注意到那个标志，所以把车停在了错误的地方

**27 A wet night**

Late in the afternoon, the boys put up their tent in a middle of a field.
As soon as this was done, they cooked a meal over an open fire.
They were all hungry and the food smelled good.
After a wonderful meal, they told stories and sang songs by the campfire.
But some time later it began to rain.
The boys felt tired so they put out the fire and crept into their tent.
Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable, so they all slept soundly.
In the middle of the night, two boys woke up and began shouting.

语法重点
1.表示"过去的过去"
在一个过去的时间点之前已经完成的动作
课文例句：
* A stream had formed in the field.
    * 小溪的形成发生在他们发现之前
* The water had found its way under their tent.
    * 水流到帐篷下面发生在他们醒来之前

例句分析：
They had looked forward to their camping trip for weeks, 
but it was spoiled by the rain.

had looked forward → 期待(更早发生)
was spoiled → 被破坏(后发生)

2.时间状语从句
* As soon as + 过去时, 主句(过去时)
* After + 动词过去式 → After he ate
* After + 动名词 → After eating

🔑 感官动词 - 后接形容词作表语
结构：感官动词 + 形容词(作表语)

smell	The food smelled good	食物闻起来很香
feel	They felt tired	他们感到疲倦
look	It looks nice	看起来不错
sound	It sounds great	听起来很棒
taste	It tastes delicious	尝起来很美味

⚠️ 注意： 这里用形容词，不用副词！
✅ smell good
❌ smell well


感官动词 = 系动词，不是被动关系！
The food smelled good. ✅
The food was smelled good.❌

为什么不用被动语态？

❌ 错误： The food was smelled good.
语法错误：被动语态后不能直接跟形容词

The food was smelled by me.
虽然语法正确，但意思完全不同
强调"我闻了食物"这个动作

感官动词的两种用法对比

作系动词（主动形式，被动意义）描述事物的性质状态
The food smells good. (食物闻起来很香)
The silk feels soft. (丝绸摸起来很软)

作实义动词（真正的被动）描述具体的动作行为
The food was smelled by the dog. (食物被狗闻了)
The fabric was felt by many customers. (布料被很多顾客摸过)


翻译：智能家居的一天

昨天是周末，李明决定测试他新买的智能家居系统。在他安装这套系统之前，他已经研究了各种品牌三个月。

早上八点，当他说出"早安"这个指令时，窗帘自动打开了。阳光看起来格外明亮，空气闻起来很清新。他感到很兴奋，因为这是他第一次使用语音控制。

到了中午，他已经测试了所有的功能。音响播放的音乐听起来非常悦耳。然而，当他试图调节空调温度时，系统突然出现了故障。

晚上，技术人员来修理设备。修理完成后，李明发现系统运行得比以前更加流畅了。

智能家居系统：smart home system
语音控制：voice control
出现故障：malfunction/break down
技术人员：technician
流畅：smoothly

Yesterday was the weekend, Li Ming decided to test his new smart home system. Before he installed this system, he had already researched all kinds of various brands for three months.
Weekend 作为特定时间概念时需要定冠词 the

At 8 o’clock in the morning, as soon as he said the command of “good morning”, the curtains was opened automatically.
The sunshine looked especially bright especially, and the air smelled very fresh. He felt very excited, because this was his first time to use using voice control.
被动语态强调： 动作的承受者 + 执行者重要
主动语态强调： 动作本身 + 更自然流畅
有明确执行者且重要 → 被动语态
自动发生/执行者不重要 → 主动语态
✅ The door was opened by the security guard.
   (强调门被保安打开，执行者重要)
✅ The window was broken by the storm.
   (强调窗户被暴风雨打破，原因重要)
✅ The curtains opened automatically. (无by + xx 无执行者/原因等需要强调的东西)
   (强调窗帘自动打开这个动作，更自然)
✅ The door closes at 6 PM.
   (强调门的关闭动作，简洁明了)

副词位置的语法规则
A. 程度副词 + 形容词：
✅ extremely beautiful
✅ very important  
✅ quite interesting
✅ especially bright
B. 方式副词位置：
✅ He speaks English fluently. (动词后)
✅ He carefully examined the document. (动词前)

By = 在...之前/到...为止（表示时间截止点）

有 before, after, by the time 等时间标志 → 考虑过去完成时
按时间顺序叙述 → 一般过去时
强调"过去的过去" → 过去完成时

分析： 发现时，修理动作已经完成（过去的过去）

例句3：
✅ By the time Li Ming woke up, the technician had finished the repair.

B. After + 过去完成时（强调完成性）

1. 自然时间顺序 ✅ He woke up, brushed his teeth, and had breakfast.
2. After引导的时间状语，主句动作紧接着发生 ✅ After the rain stopped, we went out.
3. 同一时间段内的连续动作 ✅ Yesterday, he fixed the car and then drove to work.

1. 强调"过去的过去" ✅ When I arrived, he had already left. 
2. 两个过去动作有明显的时间间隔 ✅ He said he had lived in Beijing for 10 years. 
3. 第一个动作对第二个动作有重要影响 ✅ Because he had studied hard, he passed the exam.

* 参照点： installed (过去)
* 更早动作： researched (过去的过去)
* 时间跨度： 3个月的研究 → 安装
✅ 正确使用过去完成时：
By noon, he had already tested all functions.
分析：
* 参照点： noon (过去的某个时点)
* 完成动作： tested (在中午之前已完成)
* 强调： 到中午时已经完成测试

💡 实用判断技巧
问自己这些问题：
1. 是否有明确的过去时间参照点？
    * 有 → 考虑过去完成时
    * 无 → 一般过去时
2. 是否需要强调"过去的过去"？
    * 需要 → 过去完成时
    * 不需要 → 一般过去时
3. 是否按时间顺序叙述？
    * 是 → 一般过去时
    * 否（有时间跳跃）→ 过去完成时
4. 第一个动作是否对第二个动作有重要影响？
    * 有重要影响 → 过去完成时
    * 仅仅是时间先后 → 一般过去时

🎯 回到原句
After the repair, Li Ming found that...
应用判断标准：
1. ❌ 没有明确的过去参照点需要强调
2. ❌ 不需要强调"过去的过去"
3. ✅ 按自然时间顺序叙述
4. ❌ 修理和发现是连续动作，不强调完成性
结论： 使用一般过去时是正确的！
